# Calculators
**TL;DR - This repo stores calculators I made in a variety of languages in order to test my skills in that language and understand it more thouroughly**

When I started programming, I lacked projects to make to actually apply any skills I learned for said language. One project I planned on doing and was a well-known beginner project was making a calculator using said language. But to truly test and apply my skills and knowledge, I:

- Added extra features
- Didn't use a basic "Choose operation, and 2 numbers" layout
- Did all the math manually and stood away from functions such as Python's eval()

Overtime, as I learn more languages, chances are this repository will grow. I plan to make a calculator in all languages I learn to solidify my understanding of the language. If there is anything I could do better, don't hesitate to drop an Issue or Pull Request. I would be grateful to learn how to better my *terrible* programming skills :p
